          <b>Tithi: </b>
          <p>
            The moment of new Moon, or that point of time when the longitudes of
            Sun and Moon are equal is called ‘amavasya’. The tithi is the time
            taken by the Moon in increasing its distance from the Sun by 12
            degrees. The complete revolution of the Moon (29.5 days) occupies 30
            tithis for 360 degrees. Since the motions of the Sun and Moon are
            always varying in speed the length of a tithi constantly alters
          </p>

          <p>
            Calculation of Tithi The simplest definition of a tithi is that, it
            is the phase of Moon on a given time of the year (DOY). Since the
            Moon has a periodicity of 29.5 days and since a year begins with
            Sunrise at Gudi Padwa (the day after the New Moon day at the
            beginning of spring. In the year 300 AD, spring began on the
            amavasya that heralded the month of Chaitra), in its most simple
            form the tithi on a specific day of the year,
          </p>

          <p>
            tithi(DOY) can be calculated as tithi(DOY) = longitude of Moon –
            Longitude of Sun (of the orbit of 360° )
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to map it with observable parameters, an additional factor
            is added into this formulation. The 30 tithis (from Full Moon to New
            Moon and back) are given
          </p>

          <p>
            table 1. The waning phase (from Full Moon to New Moon) is called
            Krishna Paksha and the waxing phase (from New Moon to Full Moon) is
            called Shukla Paksha and the names of tithis are reversed.

        <h4>How long is a Tithi?</h4>
        <p>
          The movements of the sun and the moon keep varying in speed. Hence,
          the length of a Tithi keeps changing. A tithi can be upto 26 hours in
          length, and it can be as less as 21 hours 34 minutes and 24 seconds.
          The time a tithi begins alters with the general time followed in each
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes a tithi can begin and end on the same day. In that case,
          there will be two tithis in one day. For instance, one may see a
          Tritiya and Chaturthi on the same day
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes a tithi can overlap into the following day. In that case,
          there will be two same tithis on two consecutive days. For instance,
          it will be Tritiya on Sunday and Monday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those days that have two Beginning or End points of tithis are
          regarded as inauspicious. The same applies if there are no beginning
          or end points of tithis.

        <h4>Nakshatra</h4>
        <p>
          In order to map this movement in the sky, different paths of the
          movement of the Moon are divided as per the nearest star or
          constellation. The names of the 27 regions, called the 27 Nakshatras
          that make this path are given in table 2. These are used to define a
          month. The name of a lunar month is given by the location of the Moon
          on the Full Moon day. Each region is about 13o 20¢ in the sky.

            Twelve pillars surround the mantappa with figures of the twelve

            that the rays of the sun fall on each pillar in the chronological
            order of the twelve months of the Hindu calendar. Each column is
            topped by a Yali with a rolling stone ball in its mouth

          In reality moon moves counter clockwise arround earth, Since earth is
          also spinning it appears that moon is lagging from sun.
